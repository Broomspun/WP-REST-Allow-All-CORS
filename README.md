Allow all cross origin requests to your WordPress site's REST API.

## Description

Allow all cross origin requests to your WordPress site's REST API.

### Frequently Asked Questions

= Would it be a security concern to allow all? =

No. I allow it. Not allowing is a gentle request that may or may not be granted. Just like `robots.txt` cannot really stop a bot from visiting your site if a bot doesn't care. I mean, remember it's not security, it's a polite request.


### Changelog

#### Release 1.0.0
* Allows all CORS.
